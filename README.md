# ATM INTERFACE
I have completed Task-3 (ATM Interface) in Java Programming.
I have tried to make this ATM interface a little bit different by adding GUI and AWT to the Program.

This program starts by taking Login details of the user, like the username and userpin.
If the login details are correct then it will take you to the ATM interface which consists of the buttons,
like Withdraw, Deposit, Trasnfer, Transaction History, Quit options.
Every time you try to use the options mentioned above you need to enter the user pin for privacy purposes.
You can see all the transcations in the History button.
If you complete your work then you can quit.
